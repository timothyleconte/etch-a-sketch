# etch-a-sketch

07-02-25 22:40 - starting the etch-a-sketch project for odin. I know this is definitely going to be a tough one. Not even really sure where to start.

07-03-25 18:08 - ended the night with almost having my canvas how I'd like. I've got the mouseover effect working but now struggling to have it maintain a 16x16 shape. Hopefully I can solve that today!

07-03-25 22:32 - I've got most of my project complete at this put except two things: solving how to clear the previous etch-a-sketch canvas & the rainbow effect; I don't think I care much for the opacity one but maybe I should do it for practice -- "the exisiting grid should be removed" (odin). I think I've got the idea in my head; now I've just got to solve it. I ran through some removeChild/loops/function errors but the previous grid still remained. I work tomorrow, so hopefully I can spend some time thinking about it during down time. The rainbow effect I believe I mostly have worked out in my head to create a button that can just trigger that effect. The big issue is clearing that previous grid.
