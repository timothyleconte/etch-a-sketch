# etch-a-sketch

07-02-25 22:40 - starting the etch-a-sketch project for odin. I know this is definitely going to be a tough one. Not even really sure where to start.

07-03-25 18:08 - ended the night with almost having my canvas how I'd like. I've got the mouseover effect working but now struggling to have it maintain a 16x16 shape. Hopefully I can solve that today!
